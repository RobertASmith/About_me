## Research:

My research is focused on the application of health economics to public health. I am working on the following projects, primarily in R software environment.

NOTE: Links won't work where the repo is private (only where data is sensitive).

### COVID-19

- COVID-19 O2 usage in Bangladesh (in progress) - Capacity modelling using R-Simmer [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/covid_bangladesh)

- COVID-19 Shiny App of R model (deployed) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/covid19_shiny)

### WHO-EUROPE HEAT

**Applying a value of a statistical life** - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/heat_vsly_public)

Repository for a journal article submitted to Journal of Transport & Health. The work compares the estimates derived by valuing life years gained by reducing mortality risk to the current approach which values deaths averted. 

**Applying a dose response function (final review)** - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/HEAT_DRF)

Repository for a journal article under final review which compares the estimates derived by using a linear dose response function between physical activity and premature mortality risk to estimates derived using a non-linear function. 

### PARKRUN

**Determinants of Parkrun Engagement** (published) - [link](https://github.com/ScHARR-PHEDS/DoPE_Public)

Work with Paul Schneider. This work is published [here](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-9). It is the first study to look at the determinants of participation in parkrun. It finds large differences in participation rates between deprived and affluent areas.

**Trends in Parkrun Engagement** (In progress) - [link](https://github.com/ScHARR-PHEDS/attachment3_parkrun)

Work with Rami Cosulich & Paul Schneider investigating whether there are trends in the determinants of participation (see above) in parkrun.

**Identifying Optimal Locations** (resubmission) - [link](https://github.com/ScHARR-PHEDS/iolmap_revision)

Work with Paul Schneider identifying the optimal green-spaces in which to start new parkruns. Being used by parkrun to short-list locations for new events.

- Time-series analysis of participation (in progress) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/parkruntimeseries)

- History of parkrun (online) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/history_of_parkrun)

### PACEM MODEL

- Physical Activity in Children Economic Model (in progress) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/pacemodel)

### WHO - HEARING LOSS

- WHO Project on Hearing Loss screening (in progess) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/hearing_loss)

### SHINY APPS

**WHO Dept. Sexual and Reproductive Health** -  Research Female Genital Mutilation (deployed) - [link](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/fgm-cost-calculator)

Converting a heemod model in R into an R-Shiny application which is now being used by the World Health Organisation.

**HTA Examplar** (in progress) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/DOAC_Shiny)

## Teaching:

I teach Advanced Simulation Methods (MSc Students) and Epidemiology (medical students) at the University of Sheffield. I have developed the following short courses in the use of R for health economics:

- Introduction to R (finished) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/Intro_to_R)

- Introductory R (in progress) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/Intermediate_R)

**Shiny for Health Economics** (submitted) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny)



- Git (in progress) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/teachGit)
