# About me

See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-smith-53b28438/) account or [website](https://www.darkpeakanalytics.com/) for more information on previous experience.

## Research:

My research is focused on the application of health economics to public health. I am working on the following projects, primarily in R software environment.

### COVID-19

**Optimal O2 and Ventilator Capacity for hospital in Bangladesh** (in progress) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/covid_bangladesh)

This is a capacity model created in R using R-Simmer. The aim is to estimate the amount of O2 and Ventilators needed to treat the population given sporadic arrival times and uncertainty in duration of stay.

**COVID-19 Shiny App of R model** (deployed) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/covid19_shiny)

This is a Shiny application which I created for a model created by David Sparkes. The application allows users to change assumptions, and reveals the sensitivity of the results to small changes in assumptions (a common problem in infectious disease models). 

### WHO-EUROPE HEAT

**Applying a value of a statistical life** - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/heat_vsly_public)

Repository for a journal article submitted to Journal of Transport & Health. The work compares the estimates derived by valuing life years gained by reducing mortality risk to the current approach which values deaths averted. 

**Applying a dose response function (final review)** - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/HEAT_DRF)

Repository for a journal article under final review which compares the estimates derived by using a linear dose response function between physical activity and premature mortality risk to estimates derived using a non-linear function. 

### PARKRUN

**Determinants of Parkrun Engagement** (published) - [link](https://github.com/ScHARR-PHEDS/DoPE_Public)

Work with Paul Schneider. This work is published [here](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-9). It is the first study to look at the determinants of participation in parkrun. It finds large differences in participation rates between deprived and affluent areas.

**Trends in Parkrun Engagement** (In progress) - [link](https://github.com/ScHARR-PHEDS/attachment3_parkrun)

Work with Rami Cosulich & Paul Schneider investigating whether there are trends in the determinants of participation (see above) in parkrun.

**Identifying Optimal Locations** (resubmission) - [link](https://github.com/ScHARR-PHEDS/iolmap_revision)

Work with Paul Schneider identifying the optimal green-spaces in which to start new parkruns. Being used by parkrun to short-list locations for new events. This paper is published as a pre-print [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004143v1.full.pdf), with an accompanying online map (created by Paul) hosted at the University of Sheffield [here](http://iol-map.shef.ac.uk/).

**Time-series analysis of participation** (in progress) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/parkruntimeseries)

Attempt to use time series analysis to understand participation in parkrun over time. Successful in splitting seasonal fluctuations from long term trends but unsuccessful in incorporating weather data as a predictor of attendance.

**History of parkrun (online)** - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/history_of_parkrun)

An animation I created to show how parkrun has grown over time. Cool start to presentations on parkrun :)

### PACEM MODEL

**Physical Activity in Children Economic Model** (in progress) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/pacemodel)

### WHO - HEARING LOSS

**WHO Project on Hearing Loss screening** (in progess) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/hearing_loss)

### SHINY APPS

**WHO Dept. Sexual and Reproductive Health** -  Research Female Genital Mutilation (deployed) - [link](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/fgm-cost-calculator)

Converted a heemod model of the cost savings associated with reductions in FGM prevalence in different countries into an R-Shiny user interface which enables users to change model parameter inputs. The application is now being used by the World Health Organisation.

**HTA Examplar** (in progress) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/DOAC_Shiny)

In progress.

## Teaching:

I teach Advanced Simulation Methods (MSc Students) and Epidemiology (medical students) at the University of Sheffield. I have developed the following short courses in the use of R for health economics:

**Introduction to R** (finished) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/Intro_to_R)

Work with Paul Schneider, Naomi Gibbs, Amy Chang, Sarah Bates & Thomas Bayley covering the basics of R with a particular focus on health data. This course ran in December 2019. It is due to be run again in May 2021.

**Intermediate R** (in progress) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/Intermediate_R)

Work with Paul Schneider in progress.

**Shiny for Health Economics** (submitted) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny)

With Paul Schneider. The paper for this course is published [here](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-69). it outlines a simple method by which a user interface can be created for a health economic evaluation model constructed in R. Using this method it is possible to create a simple but professional looking user interface in hours at no additional expense.

**Git for Health Economics** (in progress) - [link](https://github.com/RobertASmith/teachGit)

Course at early stages.
